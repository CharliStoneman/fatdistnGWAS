# This script executes inverse variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis between GIANT and UK Biobank
# The results for the three phenotypes (whr, whr, whradjwhr) and split by sex (combined, females, males) are stored in the following files:
# ./alignSNPs/ukbb/ukbb.2017.[pheno].[sex].eur.dbsnp151.ukbb.txt and ./alignSNPs/giant/giant.2015.[pheno].[sex].eur.dbsnp151.ukbb.txt
# this is an example of one metal parameters file; there is one needed for each phenotype-sex combination

# Load the input files (one from GIANT and one from UK Biobank)
